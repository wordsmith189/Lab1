This lab covers: Calculator & Objects, Numeric Vectors, Logical Vectors, Subsetting, `For` loops, `If` statements


We can ask for input from a user in R by using the function `readline()`. For example, the code below creates a custom function called `ask()` that asks for a name (saved as the variable `z`) then prints "Hello <name>!"
  
```{r}
ask <- function(){
  z <- readline("Enter your name: ")
  print(paste("Hello ", z, "!", sep=""))
}

ask()
```


1. Ask for a positive number and return a vector of all the integers between 1 and the input. For example, if the user picks 5, your code should return `1 2 3 4 5`.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter a number: ")
  num <- as.numeric(num) # Note that we're telling R to interpret the input (num) as a number!
  return # your code here
}
ask()
```


2. Ask for a number and return a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and the input. Hint: You can do this with a loop, or you can try reading about the function `seq()` by typing `?seq()` into the console.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter a number: ")
  num <- as.numeric(num)
  ans <-  # your code here
  return(ans)
}
ask()
```


3. Ask for a positive integer n. Return the sum: 1 + 1∕2 + 1∕3 + 1∕4 + ⋯ + 1∕n. Hint: learn about the `sum()` function.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter a number: ")
  num <- as.numeric(num)
  ans <-  # your code here
  return(ans)
}
ask()
```


4. Ask for a positive integer `n`. Return a vector with elements: `1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... , 1/n`.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter a number: ")
  num <- as.numeric(num)
  ans <-  # your code here
  return(ans)
}
ask()
```


5. Using the vectors provided, ask for a number and print the name of the person at that index, and whether or not they like cake.

```{r}
people <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve")
likesCake <-  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter a number between 1 and 5: ")
  num <- as.numeric(num)
  
  name <-  #your code here
  
  if( ){ # add your code to the if statement
    print(paste(name, " likes cake"))
    
  } else {
    print(paste(name, "does not like cake"))
  }
}
ask()
```


6. Ask for a start and end, then return all elements of the provided vector between those indices.

```{r}
vector <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
ask <- function(){
  start <- readline("Enter start: ")
  end <- readline("Enter end: ")
  ans <- #your code here
  return(ans) 
}
ask()
```


7. Ask the user for 5 numbers and add them one by one to a vector.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  vector <-  c()
  for( ){ # make this loop 5 times
    num <- readline("Enter a number: ")
    num <- as.numeric(num)
    # your code here 
  }
  return(vector)
}
ask()
```


8. Print a vector that is `TRUE` when the sum of the given vectors is greater than 5 and `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
vec1 <- c(0,1,2,4,1,5,6,2,3)
vec2 <- c(4,3,5,4,8,9,4,2,3)

sumFive <- #your code here

print(sumFive)
```


9. Ask for the total of a bill and return the amount of a 15% tip. The `round()` function is useful for cleaning up the result to an even penny. Use `?round` to see the help documentation.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter total: $")
  num <- as.numeric(num)
  ans <-  # your code here
  return(ans)
}
ask()
```


10. Ask for a user’s birth year and print the age they will turn this year. You can write the current year directly without trying to determine it externally (it is possible to determine the current year, but was not covered in Chapter 2).

```{r}
ask <- function(){
  num <- readline("Enter your birth year: ")
  # your code here
  print(paste("You turned (or are turning)", ans, "years old this year."))
}
ask()
```


11. Write a function which asks for a number and determines if it is a whole number. Print a message displaying the result using `print`.
```{r}
ask <- function(){
   # your code here
}
ask()
```


12. The factorial of an integer is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to it. For example, the factorial of 4 is equal to 4 ∗ 3 ∗ 2 ∗ 1=24. There is a function factorial in base R for calculating these. Ask for a number and return the factorial, without using the R function. Hint: The function `prod` may be helpful.

```{r}
ask <- function(){
   # your code here
}
ask()
```


13. Let's play a game! Randomly pick a number between 1 and 10, then give the user 3 attempts to guess correctly. Your game should tell the user when they've won, if they guessed wrong and should try again, or if they've lost. Hint: you'll need the function `sample()`. Use `?sample` to learn about it! You'll also want to use `break()` to stop your loop when they win.

```{r}
play <- function(){
   # your code here
}

play()
```


BONUS CHALLENGE. Re-write your game to pick a number between 1 and 20, give them 5 guesses, and give hints like "warmer" or "colder" after each guess.

```{r}
play <- function(){
  # your code here
}

play()
```
